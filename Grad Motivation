Motivation is not just an internal issue—it is also a systemic result.

In our new study, we integrated Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with dynamic systems theory to analyze how graduates' motivation during the transition from education to work is shaped by different job sectors.

📊 What do the findings say?

Private sector: Offers high motivation potential, but it is unstable. Even small uncertainties can quickly undermine motivation.

Public sector: More stable and consistent, but typically progresses with flatter motivation curves.

Unemployment: The riskiest situation. It can turn into a low motivation trap and make it difficult to escape.  

Our regression analyses and artificial data simulations paint a clear picture:  
🎯 Autonomy and intrinsic motivation are powerful factors that increase motivation.  
⚠️ Uncertainty, however, systematically reduces motivation.

💡 So what should be done?  

Employers: They should build work environments that support autonomy while reducing uncertainty. Effective orientation, mentoring, and feedback systems are no longer a luxury but a necessity.  

Policy makers: Fair job security policies and investments in skill development that support lifelong learning should take priority.

Educational institutions: They should educate students not only as graduates but as resilient individuals through project-based learning and career planning.

🔄 In the future workplace, it will not be just flexibility or just stability; contextual adaptation and guided support will play a key role.

Our goal in conducting this study was not only to present a theoretical model but also to offer actionable recommendations. We believe that these findings must be put into practice to create stronger individual career paths, more resilient organizations, and social well-being.

📌 For those interested: This model can be tested and developed using real-world data. However, it already offers an important perspective:
Early career motivation depends more on the design of the system than on the individual.
